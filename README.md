For the various Labs my robots is instructed to follow varying instructions. 
For Lab1 Task1. The goal of the robot is to navigate a previously known maze
For Lab2 Task1. The goal of the robot is to utilize PID motion to stop .5 meters in front of a wall by continously sensing and changing velocity until within the desired range.
For Lab2 Task2. The goal of the robot is to follow a wall on either the right or left and continue until it's destination is reached.
For Lab2 Task1. The goal of the robot is to first rotate until it sees the goal, and then move to the goal.
For Lab2 Task2. The goal of the robot is to switch between two states. The first state is motion to goal, which the robot will do when it has a path that can be taken towards the goal. The second state is wall following, which will occur when there is an obstacle 
in front of the robots path to the goal. By alternating between these two states, the robot will be able to reach the goal.
